# QAOA-MaxCut-Qiskit

A simple Python implementation and initial introduction to the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) using Qiskit, demonstrated on the MaxCut problem.

In this example, we use a graph with four vertices and four edges to determine the optimal coloring that maximizes the number of cut edges. This serves as a practical introduction to QAOA and its application to combinatorial optimization problems. 

A generalization of this method can also be used to approximate the ground-state energy of physical systems.
